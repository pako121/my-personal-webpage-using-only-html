        <br>I love watching anime, and listening to kpop,
        <br>but what I really love is reading comics. I reads comics when I have free time.
        <br>Some of my friends asking me "why you like reading comics a lot?"
        <br>well Comic books combine the depth and imagination of books with the visuals of movies, and don't have to worry about making something look realistic. 
        <br>When reading a comic book, the art creates the world. It may look cartoony compared to reality, but it's 'real' in terms of that one comic.
	    It also gives me happiness and peace.</font></i></p>
	    <p><br><i><font face="Arial" style="font-size:30px;" color="yellow">My goals in life are to study hard, be my dream job and give my family a better life.
        <br>I also have a inspirational qoute and I would like to share it â€œTrust yourself that you can do it" 
        <br>this quote is by Baz Luhrmann. I always relay my life to this qoute, this means eve how hard life is I would still
        <br>fight, even if a lot of works to do I will accomplish it and even there is the time you wanted to give up just talk to go, "you can do it"
        I am also inspired by my grandmother.</font></i></p>
